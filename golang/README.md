# Redis-In-Action
Rewrite the code from the amazing book Redis-In-Action using `golang` and `go-redis/redis`, using `Go Modules` to manager the dependency.

### Configuration:

- All config messages are in the config/config.go file. Including the connection config to redis and a file path which used in Chapter05.
- Modify it to your own configuration information when needed.

### Running：

#### Using Docker: 

> Tips for Chinese users: check the Dockerfile before running,  uncomment line 4, this will speed you building process.

- check the config messages in the config/config.go file first, you may need to set your config for redis
- run `docker-compose up -d` in the directory.
- use `docker exec -it redis-in-action-golang go test ./Chapter0*/redisConn_test.go -v` to run the test, use number 1 through 8 to replace the `*` depending on the Chapter's examples you want to run.
- for testing in `redisConn` subdirectory, please use `docker exec -it redis-in-action-golang go test ./redisConn/redisConn_test.go ./redisConn/redisConn.go -v`.

#### Using command-line/terminal: 

Open a command-line/terminal in the `golang` directory and execute follow command:

- `go mod download` to download the dependency, then:

- `go test ./Chapter0*/redisConn_test.go -v`, use number 1 through 8 to replace the `*`  depending on the Chapter's examples you want to run.

- `go test ./redisConn/redisConn_test.go ./redisConn/redisConn.go -v` executes testing in `redisConn` subdirectory.
